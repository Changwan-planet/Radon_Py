## Parabolic Radon Transform

Time domain Parabolic Radon transform via the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method with implicit forward and adjoint Radon operators. The Radon domain coefficients $m(\tau,p)$ are found by minimizing the following quadratic cost function

$$J =\| Lm - d \|_2^2 + \mu \| m \|_2^2\,.$$
â€‹
The seismic gather is given by $d(t,x)$, and $L$ provides the Radon forward operator in implicit form. The scalar $\mu$ is the trade-off parameter of the problem.
Notice that CG requires the operators $L$ (Forward) and $L'$  (adjoint or transpose operator). Check `radon_forward` and `radon_adjoint` in `radon_lib.py`. These two operators are functions that pass the dot product test.

The implicit form of the operators is given by

$$ d = L m \quad \equiv \quad d(t,x) = \sum_q m(t-q x^2,x) $$

$$ m' = L' d \quad \equiv \quad m'(\tau,q) = \sum_x d(\tau+q x^2,x) $$

The parameter $q x^2$ is replaced by $q (x/x_{max})^2$. Then, the variable $q$ is residual moveout at far offset and it is measured in seconds.

Running the program: `python main.py`. You will first need to install  the following libraries `numba`, `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

You can modify the code to also compute linear and hyperbolic Radon transforms. In those
case, the integration path $\tau + q x^2$ is replaced by $\tau +  p x$ and $\sqrt{\tau^2 + (x/v)^2}$. Then we can estimate eiehter $m(\tau,p)$ (Linear Radon Transform)
or $m(\tau,v)$ (Hyperpolic Radon Transform also called Velocity Stack).
